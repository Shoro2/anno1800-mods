Old World traders now always offer a selection of 12 items out of all Legendary and Epic items available.

Archibald Blake sells items for:

    Ships
    Sailing Ships
    Steamships
    Military Ships
    Salvager
    Airships


Eli Bleakworth sells items for:

    Trade Union
    Town Hall
    Harbourmaster's Office
    Arctic Lodge


Madame Kahina sells items for:

    Museum
    Zoo
    Botanical Garden
    Music Pavilion


Update 1.1 - Isabel Sarmento (New World) sells Common, Uncommon and Rare items for:

    Museum
    Zoo
    Botanical Garden
    Music Pavilion


Keep in mind that all these items are quite expensive to buy, and they will no longer offer any items below Epic quality. But if you're using this mod, you're probably also using a money cheat anyway ;)

Issues:
the re-roll button overlaps the last row of items In the small window that shows a trader's items for sale. It doesn't hurt the functionality, just looks ugly. It's not an issue in the large trade window between harbour and ship.
