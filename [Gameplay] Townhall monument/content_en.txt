Townhall-monument 1.0.1

This mod adds a special townhall, which you can build up in 3 stages. To compesate it's size it has some advantages compared to a normal townhall. 
It does have a much wider radius and 6 slots for items/specialists (scroll up/down). The model is based on the Hamburg City Hall (not 100 % faithful).
You need 7500 investors to unlock this building.

!!!This mod is compatible with already existing savegames. No Unlocker is needed!!!

After you installed the mod, you can find the townhall-monument in the investors-building-menu.


Update 1.0.1 Notes:

- An additional texture has been added highlighting the depths and elevations on the building, so the building now looks more realistic

- the windows were darkened

- the roof was slightly overworked

- Lights at night have been improved

- the clocks now show the current time


Much fun wishes from
